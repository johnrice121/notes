# Notes

Notes, thoughts, and reflections on technology, life, and practical futurism.

## Purpose

This repository is a personal space for capturing evolving ideas and reflections at the intersection of:

- **Technology & software engineering**, including reliable system architecture, AI-augmented workflows, and human–machine collaboration
- **Health and movement science**, including exercise science, biomechanics, and human performance
- **Pragmatic futurism**, focusing on practical trends, emerging tools, and how humans navigate change
- **Ethics, virtue, and meaning**, especially as they relate to technology and daily life

This repository isn’t a formal blog — it’s a notebook of ideas I return to, refine, and develop over time.

## Themes I Explore

Topics you’ll likely find here include (but are not limited to):

- Human–AI symbiosis, practical constraints, responsibility, and alignment
- Software engineering insights, maintainability, testability, and architecture
- Intersections of movement science with cognition, performance, and health
- Reflections on personal growth, ethical decision-making, and meaningful progress
- Pragmatic approaches to the future — how incremental choices shape outcomes

## About Me
